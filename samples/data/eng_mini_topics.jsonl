In the sense of \"flowing water\", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise.","lang_resources":{"fas":{"title_translation":"\u0637\u063a\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646","description_translation":"\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0637 \u0628\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u0644."},"rus":{"title_translation":"\u041d\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435","description_translation":"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0438, \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438."},"zho":{"title_translation":"\u6d2a\u6c34","description_translation":"\u4e0e\u6d2a\u6c34\u6709\u5173\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002"}},"lang_supported":["fas","rus","zho"]}

In a religious context, the word has been used since the 18th century, and in the political sense since the 1920s, coinciding with the rise of totalitarian governments in countries such as Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. In the Western world, there are historical examples of people who have been considered and have considered themselves dissidents, such as the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. In totalitarian countries, dissidents are often incarcerated without explicit political accusations, or due to infringements of the very same laws they are opposing, or because they are supporting civil liberties such as freedom of speech.","lang_resources":{"fas":{"title_translation":"\u0645\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0641\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646","description_translation":"\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0637 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0633\u06cc."},"rus":{"title_translation":"\u0414\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435","description_translation":"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0438 \u043e \u0434\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445."},"zho":{"title_translation":"\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u89c1\u8005\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u72af","description_translation":"\u4e0e\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u89c1\u8005\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u72af\u6709\u5173\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002"}},"lang_supported":["fas","rus","zho"]}
